# Linear Regression Machine Learning
This is a program that generates a simple data set and feeds it to a training algorithm, resulting in a model capable of making user-prompted predictions.

# WARNING
This program is currently in its earlier stages, please use small datasets and restart the program instead of regenerating data or repeating training to avoid crashes.
